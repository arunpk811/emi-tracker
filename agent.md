# AI Agent Workflow: SC-EMI Tracker

This document outlines the systematic process followed by the AI Agent (Antigravity) when implementing features or fixes in the SC-EMI Tracker project.

## Workflow Overview

1.  **Analyze Requirements**
    *   Thoroughly review the user's request to understand the objective.
    *   Research existing codebase for context and potential integration points.
    *   Clarify any ambiguities before starting the implementation.

2.  **Execute Code Changes**
    *   Implement logic and UI components using the project's tech stack (React, Vanilla CSS).
    *   Adhere to design principles: Premium aesthetics, Glassmorphism, and Mobile-first responsiveness.
    *   Ensure semantic HTML and clean, maintainable code structure.

3.  **Conduct Testing & Validation**
    *   Run the development server (`npm run dev`) to verify visual changes.
    *   Perform functional tests to ensure new features work as expected.
    *   Check for responsiveness across different screen sizes (Mobile vs. Desktop).
    *   Verify console for any errors or warnings.

4.  **Commit & Deploy**
    *   **Git Commit**: Stage all relevant changes and create a descriptive commit message that summarizes the work done.
    *   **Deployment**: Ensure the code is ready for production build (`npm run build`).
    *   Maintain a clean repository state by committing logical increments of work.
